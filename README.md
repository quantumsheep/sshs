Terminal user interface for SSH.  
It uses `~/.ssh/config` to list and connect to hosts.

## Requirements

You need to have `ssh` installed and accessible from your terminal.

## How to install

### Homebrew

```shell
brew install sshs
```

### Chocolatey

Thanks to [Jakub Lev√Ω](https://github.com/jakublevy/chocopkgs/tree/master/sshs) for maintaining this package on Chocolatey.

```shell
choco install sshs
```

### Arch Linux

```shell
pacman -S sshs
```

### Alpine Linux

`sshs` is available in Alpine Linux [testing repository](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/package/edge/testing/x86_64/sshs).

```shell
apk add sshs
```

### NixOS / Nix

#### As a Flake

```shell
nix profile install 'github:quantumsheep/sshs'
```

#### In your NixOS configuration

```nix
environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [ sshs ];
```

#### In your Home Manager configuration

```nix
home.packages = with pkgs; [ sshs ];
```

### From releases

Releases contains prebuilt binaries for Linux, macOS and Windows. You can download them at <https://github.com/quantumsheep/sshs/releases>.

### From sources

Building sshs from sources requires [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) compiler and [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) to be installed. You can install them with [rustup](https://rustup.rs).

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/quantumsheep/sshs
```

Be sure to have `~/.cargo/bin` in your `PATH` environment variable.

You can also clone the repository and build it manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/quantumsheep/sshs.git
cd sshs
cargo build --release
```

The binary will be located at `./target/release/sshs` once the build is complete.

## Troubleshooting

### [...]/.ssh/config: no such file or directory

- Check if you have `~/.ssh/config` file
- If you don't, you can create it with `touch ~/.ssh/config`

If you want to use another SSH config file, you can use the `--config` option.

Here's a sample `~/.ssh/config` file:

```nginx
Host *
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  UseKeychain yes
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Host "My server"
  HostName server1.example.com
  User root
  Port 22

Host "Go through Proxy"
  HostName server2.example.com
  User someone
  Port 22
  ProxyCommand ssh -W %h:%p proxy.example.com
```

You can check the [OpenBSD `ssh_config` reference](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5) for more information on how to setup `~/.ssh/config`.
